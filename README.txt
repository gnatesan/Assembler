Project 6
2/16/14

This project took me approximately 11 hours. I collaborated with Nicholas Corl. This assignment was extremely
hard for me. I am glad that I was granted an extension for it. Some parts were not hard, they just took a 
long time, such as hard coding binary representations of certain parts of the instruction. The difficult
part for me was mainly with String parsing. I had a lot of errors with reading the file and evaluating 
the different types of instructions. I spent over half of my time debugging my code. 


Instructions to run code:
1. Open up the terminal and go into directory of src folder of java project
2. Inside the src directory, enter javac GNAssembler.java, to compile program
3. Then, enter java GNAssembler Add.asm
4. Repeat step 3, replacing Add.asm with all the other asm files
5. Output files should have the same name as the .asm files, except now its .hack (add.hack, etc)
